Solver configuration
====================

The `Cfg` structure is how to tune and adjust this position solver.  
This solver is smart enough to generate more than decent results even if we rely on default settings
(quick test / quick setups).

Note that we always prefer precision over computation load.  
In other words, for each mode the default options are already computation intensive
and can be simplified.
