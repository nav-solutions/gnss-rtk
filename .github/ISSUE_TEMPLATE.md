## GNSS-RTK reporting

Thank you for using our library and trying to make it better 🛰️ 🌍

If experiencing issues with `GNSS-RTK`, we recommend you turn on the applications
log with `$RUST_LOG`. The `debug` level is a minimum and might be enough, 
but `trace` will exhibit all the debug traces we have. If you can share that with us,
we can help you debug your applications and hopefuly help you resolve solutions.
